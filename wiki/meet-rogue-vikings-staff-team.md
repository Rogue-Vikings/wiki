## Learn about donator ranks

::: details How does Rogue Vikings combat Pay2Win?
This is a crucial question, and one we approach with the utmost seriousness. RogueVikings is a small, privately-owned start-up based in the United States, legally registered as a "Single-Member LLC." As a small business, we recognize the importance of having a robust monetization model and strategy to cover our monthly and annual operational costs and expenses. A well-structured model is essential for the expansion of our gaming servers and sustainable growth.

We are acutely aware of the potential negative impact of Pay2Win models on server communities. As avid gamers ourselves, we share your concerns about these models. Therefore, we have designed our system to ensure that all in-game and Discord purchases can also be earned through playtime, Discord voice participation, voting rewards, and other in-game activities.

We offer multiple avenues for dedicated players who may not be able to contribute financially to still earn rewards. We understand that adults with jobs and family commitments often cannot devote 6-10 hours a day to gaming, unlike younger players who may have more free time. Consequently, the more mature audience may choose to spend money to bridge the gap with those who have higher playtimes.

While our system is not perfect, it strikes a balance that supports both contributors and dedicated players. We continually strive to refine this balance to ensure a fair and engaging experience for all.
